    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a uni-directional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirection RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",

    "#### - Forget gate\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this illustration, lets assume we are reading words in a piece of text, and want use an LSTM to keep track of grammatical structures, such as whether the subject is singular or plural. If the subject changes from a singular word to a plural word, we need to find a way to get rid of our previously stored memory value of the singular/plural state. In an LSTM, the forget gate lets us do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_f[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_f)\\tag{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_f$ are weights that govern the forget gate's behavior. We concatenate $[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ and multiply by $W_f$. The equation above results in a vector $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with values between 0 and 1. This forget gate vector will be multiplied element-wise by the previous cell state $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. So if one of the values of $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is 0 (or close to 0) then it means that the LSTM should remove that piece of information (e.g. the singular subject) in the corresponding component of $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. If one of the values is 1, then it will keep the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Update gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we forget that the subject being discussed is singular, we need to find a way to update it to reflect that the new subject is now plural. Here is the formulat for the update gate: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_u[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\{t\\}}] + b_u)\\tag{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the forget gate, here $\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is again a vector of values between 0 and 1. This will be multiplied element-wise with $\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, in order to compute $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Updating the cell \n",
    "\n",
    "To update the new subject we need to create a new vector of numbers that we can add to our previous cell state. The equation we use is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_c[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_c)\\tag{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new cell state is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}* c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + \\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} *\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} \\tag{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Output gate\n",

    "$$ \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}=  \\sigma(W_o[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_o)\\tag{5}$$ \n",
